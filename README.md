# ermis

https://openai.com/api/ (grab an api key and paste it in config)

https://discord.com/login?redirect_to=%2Fdevelopers%2Fapplications (create a bot and paste its token in config)

run the .bat file to keep it running 

will need node.js, colors and the openai package

just install node.js and run npm i in the powershell

thatll do

btw open ai isnt completely free so you might have to switch accs often and create new keys if u use the bot too much

you should replace all channel ids in bot.js otherwise the bots gonna crash. might want to edit all embeds that mention ermis as well.

about the ai parameters, you can mess with those. in fact its even recommendable you screw with them to find out what works best.
